## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used stackoverflow to help.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I did not not know how to change the properties of the buttons at first. To fix this problem I searched online for answers, but none of the buttons were made in a similar way to the end button I was modifying. I eventually kept trying different ways to modify it until I tried the correct way. After I solved this issue it made the whole rest of the project much easier.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After I finished my submission I found it pretty cool that this game could be made using html and all on this website, including the audio. I wonder how websites with even more functions are made and the processes that people go through when deciding what features to put in. I wonder how long an average site takes to make. I also wonder how long it takes people to make flash games through html and the ways they implement features.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would add a feature that changed the pattern randomly that the computer decided. I would also add a feature that allowed the player to select the colors of the buttons and the length of time that the computer holds down the button.
